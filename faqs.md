## I joined for roleplaying/game talk/trans shitposting/etc. but I don't see the channels.

You need to add roles to see those!

Go to our [Roleypoly] instance to add them yourself.

Trans -> treehouse
Roleplayer -> RP channels, meta
Gamer -> games

## There's something unclear in the rules.

Awesome! Thanks for bringing that up! Please, make yourself at home and suggest a revision. We happily accept [issues] and [pull requests], but if that's something you feel comfortable doing, please ask a mod to do it for you.

When we all pitch in, making this place welcoming becomes easy!

## There needs to be a channel for X

We don't want to spawn too many channels, but if 3-4 people ask for one, mods are empowered to create it.
